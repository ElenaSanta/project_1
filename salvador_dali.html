                    Salvador Dalí was one of the most versatile and prolific painters of<br>
                    the 20th century. Although he is best remembered for his painting,<br>
                    during his long career he also dabbled in sculpture, printmaking,<br>
                    fashion, advertising, writing, and, perhaps most famously, filmmaking,<br>
                    collaborating with Luis Bunuel and Alfred Hitchcock. Dalí was known for<br>
                    his flamboyant personality and unquestionable technical mastery. In his<br>
                    early use of organic morphology, his works bear the hallmarks of his<br>
                    Spanish contemporaries Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró. His paintings also<br>
                    demonstrate a fascination with Classical and Renaissance art, evident<br>
                    in the surrealist style and religious symbolism of his later works. Dalí<br>
                    is often associated with the Surrealist movement, despite his official<br>
                    expulsion from the group in 1934 for his reactionary political views.
